The first step is to fork the documentation repository.

But for this demo we will only clone it in the playground.

## Task

Clone our example repository that contains the template documentation with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/doctools.template-site.git template-docsite`{{execute}}

Within the repository, you will see the following important items:

- /docs : the folder where you will write your Markdown doc.
- /mkdocs.yml : the file where you will define the doc site structure and configure the redirects.

Let's have a look at the`template-docsite/mkdocs.yml`{{open}} file.

As you can see it's a very short config.
